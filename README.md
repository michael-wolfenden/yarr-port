# yarr-port-typescript

My take on 'Yet Another RSS Reader' - https://github.com/channikhabra/yarr

## Getting started

This will install all npm packages

    > npm install

## Development build

This will run a live reload server at http://localhost:8080/index.html

    > npm start

## Production build

This will package the application and output to /build

    > npm run production
